# git-easy-checkout

Maybe it's just me, but sometimes when I switch branches I can't remember the exact name of the branch I want to switch to. The autocomplete is not smart enough to filter the list of branches according to my input. So I wrote this tool to make it easier for me to switch branches.

I'm pretty sure there are other tools or scripts out there that do the same thing, but I just want to write my own in `rust` :)

## Usage

```bash
$ git-easy-checkout

# then just typing a part of the branch name you remember or scroll through the list of branches
```
